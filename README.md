# MiGA-Docker
MiGA - the Microbial Genome Atlas - for everyone!  
Now there is a single docker image for MiGA so that both the command line version and MiGA-Web version can be run under Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. The same image can also be installed in a user's home directory on a high performance cluster using Singularity.
