# Add Reference Databases using MiGA-Web

To install one or both of the reference datbases using the browser interface, first start MiGA-Web, create an account if you have not already done so, and log in. Then go to the **Admin console** page, click on **Download databases**, and choose one of the blue buttons to start the download. These are large files, so you will need a fast internet connection and plenty of time.
